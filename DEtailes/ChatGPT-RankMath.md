Perfect 👌 You’re in the **Rank Math SEO Setup Wizard** — “Your Site” section.  
Let’s fill this out _correctly for Aexaware Infotech_ to maximize SEO and Knowledge Panel consistency.

Here’s exactly what to enter for **each field** 👇

* * *

### 🏢 **Aexaware Infotech – Rank Math Setup (“Your Site” tab)**

| Field | What to Enter | Notes / SEO Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Aexaware Infotech is a…** | ✅ **Small Business Site** | You’re an IT company serving startups, SMEs, and enterprises — this option fits perfectly. |
| **Website Name** | `Aexaware Infotech – Smart IT Solutions That Scale` | Great tagline — keep it. It’s within the ideal 55–65 characters for brand + USP. |
| **Website Alternate Name** | `Aexaware Infotech` | Keep it short — this helps Google recognize both your brand and its simplified version. |
| **Person/Organization Name** | `Aexaware Infotech Private Limited` | Always use the **registered business name** for schema accuracy (matches your ROC/Wikipedia data). |
| **Logo for Google** | Upload your **primary company logo** in square format (PNG preferred).  
✅ Size: 512x512 px (minimum 112x112)  
✅ File name: `aexaware-logo.png` | This is used in **Organization schema** and Knowledge Panel. A square logo avoids cropping. |
| **Default Social Share Image** | Upload a **1200x630 px** OpenGraph image.  
Example design: white background, your logo centered, tagline below.  
✅ File name: `aexaware-og-default.jpg` | Appears as the preview image when any page/post lacks its own OG image. Boosts CTR on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. |

* * *

### ✅ **Next Step (after Save and Continue)**

Once you hit **Save and Continue**, you’ll go to the **Analytics** tab.  
Before that, make sure your **logo and OG image filenames** are clean (no spaces or capitals), e.g.

```

## Response:
Excellent 💪 — you’re now in the **“Sitemaps”** step of the Rank Math SEO setup.  
This section tells Google **what content** from your site should appear in search results.

Here’s exactly how to configure it for **Aexaware Infotech (IT agency site built with Elementor + Royal/ElementsKit)** 👇

* * *

🗺️ **Rank Math Sitemap Configuration for Aexaware Infotech**
-------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | What to Do | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **✅ Enable “Sitemaps”** | **ON** | Essential for search engines to discover and crawl all important pages. |
| **✅ Include Images** | **ON** | Helps Google index your portfolio, blog visuals, and UI/UX images — boosts image search visibility. |

* * *

### **Public Post Types**

| Option | Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Posts** | ✅ **Check** | Needed for all your blog articles (“Tech Insights”, “Linux”, “AI/ML”, etc.). |
| **Pages** | ✅ **Check** | Includes service pages (Web Dev, App Dev, AI/ML, etc.), About, Contact, Portfolio. |
| **Floating Elements / Widgets / Templates / Site Builder / Royal Templates / Royal Mega Menu / Elementor Header & Footer Builder / ElementsKit items** | ❌ **Uncheck all** | These are **design components**, not content pages. Including them will clutter your sitemap and confuse Google. |

🟢 **Only keep:**

> ✅ Posts  
> ✅ Pages

* * *

### **Public Taxonomies**

| Option | Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Categories** | ✅ **Check** | Important if your blogs are grouped into categories like “AI/ML”, “Web Development”, “DevOps”, etc. |
| **Tags (if shown)** | ❌ **Uncheck** (optional) | Tags create duplicate thin-content pages unless used properly. Skip unless you actively maintain tag pages. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Sitemap Output (after saving)**

Once saved, your sitemap index should automatically be available at:  
👉 **[https://aexaware.com/sitemap\_index.xml](https://aexaware.com/sitemap_index.xml)**

This file will include:

*   `/page-sitemap.xml`
*   `/post-sitemap.xml`
*   `/category-sitemap.xml`

You’ll then **submit this URL to Google Search Console** for indexing.

* * *

**Next Step → Optimization tab**  
Would you like me to give you the _exact recommended settings for “Optimization”_ (titles, noindex rules, link stripping, etc.) next? That’s where we fine-tune crawling and link SEO signals.

Noindex Empty Category and Tag Archives

Setting empty archives to noindex is useful for avoiding indexation of thin content pages and dilution of page rank. As soon as a post is added, the page is updated to index.

Nofollow External Links

Automatically add rel="nofollow" attribute for external links appearing in your posts, pages, and other post types. The attribute is dynamically applied when the content is displayed, and the stored content is not changed.

Open External Links in New Tab/Window

Automatically add a target="_blank" attribute to external links appearing in your posts, pages, and other post types. The attributes are applied when the content is displayed, which does not change the stored content.

## Response:
Perfect ✅ — you’re now in the **“Optimization”** step of the Rank Math SEO setup.  
This step is where we fine-tune how links and archive pages behave for better rankings and user experience.

Here’s exactly how to configure these options for **Aexaware Infotech** 👇

* * *

⚙️ **Rank Math – Optimization Settings for Aexaware Infotech**
--------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Noindex Empty Category and Tag Archives** | ✅ **Turn ON** | Prevents empty blog categories or tags (with no posts yet) from being indexed — avoids thin content penalties and keeps your crawl budget focused on valuable pages. |
| **Nofollow External Links** | ✅ **Turn ON** | Automatically adds `rel="nofollow"` to all outgoing links. This tells Google not to pass link equity to other domains and keeps your site’s authority concentrated. Excellent for a company site that links to external tools (e.g., GitHub, Stripe, etc.). |
| **Open External Links in New Tab/Window** | ✅ **Turn ON** | Improves user experience — when someone clicks an external link, your website stays open in their original tab, reducing bounce rate and keeping visitors longer. |

* * *

### ✅ Recommended Combination

*   ✅ **Noindex empty categories/tags**
*   ✅ **Nofollow external links**
*   ✅ **Open external links in new tab**

Once you’ve checked all three, click **“Save and Continue.”**

* * *

Next, you’ll move to the **“Ready”** page — the final step where Rank Math confirms setup and offers to connect analytics and sitemap submission.

Would you like me to walk you through **the best “Ready” screen setup + post-installation checklist** (Google Search Console, Analytics linking, schema verification, etc.) right after this?

Excellent 👏 — you’ve reached one of the most **important Rank Math SEO screens: “Schema Markup.”**  
This is where you teach Google **what each type of page or post means** (blog, service, product, etc.), so your search results can display **rich snippets** like ratings, FAQs, or organization info.

Here’s the ideal setup for **Aexaware Infotech (Tech / IT Solutions Company)** 👇

* * *

🧩 **Rank Math – Schema Markup Settings for Aexaware Infotech**
---------------------------------------------------------------

| Content Type | Recommended Schema | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Schema Type for Posts** | ✅ **Article → BlogPosting** | This tells Google that your posts are informational blog articles. It enables rich results like featured snippets and helps your _Tech Insights_ or _SEO blogs_ rank better. |
| **Article Type** | ✅ **BlogPosting** | The “BlogPosting” subtype fits company blog articles (e.g., AI, Linux, DevOps topics). “NewsArticle” is only for news publishers — not needed here. |
| **Schema Type for Pages** | ✅ **WebPage → Service** | This makes every main page (Home, About, Services, Contact) recognized as a **Service page**. It helps Google understand your site’s business nature and can display “Service” rich results in SERPs. |
| **Schema Type for Floating Elements, Elementor, Widgets, Templates, Site Builder, etc.** | ❌ **None** | These are design components and shouldn’t be indexed or marked with schema. Keeping them set to “None” prevents confusing structured data and keeps your SEO clean. |

* * *

### ✅ Step-by-Step Summary

1.  **Schema Type for Posts:**
    *   Select **Article**
    *   Under **Article Type**, choose **BlogPosting**
2.  **Schema Type for Pages:**
    *   Click “Set One” → choose **Service** (or **WebPage** if it’s a general info page like About/Contact)
3.  **Everything else (Elementor, Templates, Widgets, etc.):**
    *   Leave as **None**
4.  ✅ Click **Save and Continue**

* * *

### 💡 After Setup (Advanced Tip)

Once setup is done:

*   Edit key pages (like “Web Development,” “AI/ML Integration,” “Contact”)
*   Scroll to the **Rank Math → Schema tab**
*   Manually add:
    *   **Organization Schema** on Home Page
    *   **LocalBusiness Schema** on Contact Page
    *   **FAQ Schema** on service pages (Rank Math FAQ Block)
    *   **Project/CreativeWork Schema** for portfolio case studies

These additional schemas can help your search results show rich FAQ dropdowns and business info panels.

* * *

Would you like me to list **which schema types to manually add** (page-by-page for Home, About, Services, Blog, and Contact) after this setup is saved? That will complete your Rank Math SEO schema structure perfectly.

Perfect 🔥 — you’re now in **Rank Math → Links Settings**, where you control how URLs and outbound links behave.  
This section affects crawl efficiency, authority flow, and user experience — so let’s lock in the **best SEO configuration for Aexaware Infotech** 👇

* * *

🔗 **Rank Math – Links Settings for Aexaware Infotech**
-------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Strip Category Base** | ✅ **ON** | Makes blog URLs cleaner and shorter.  
Example: `aexaware.com/category/ai-ml/` → `aexaware.com/ai-ml/`.  
This improves UX and keyword relevance in URLs. |
| **Redirect Attachments** | ✅ **ON** | Prevents thin “media attachment” pages (just the image) from being indexed. Instead, they redirect to the parent blog post or page — preserving link equity. |
| **Redirect Orphan Attachments** | Enter: `https://aexaware.com` | Sends any unattached media URLs (images uploaded directly to Media Library) back to your homepage instead of returning a 404. |
| **Nofollow External Links** | ✅ **ON** | Prevents link juice from leaking to other sites — perfect for blogs that reference external tools, GitHub repos, etc. |
| **Nofollow Image File Links** | ✅ **ON** | Stops Google from crawling externally hosted image URLs (like CDN assets or third-party media). Keeps crawl focus on your own domain. |
| **Nofollow Domains** | _(Leave blank)_ | This applies nofollow to **all** external links — exactly what we want for Aexaware’s blog & service pages. |
| **Nofollow Exclude Domains** | Add the following list: \`\`\`linkedin.com |  |
| instagram.com |  |  |
| twitter.com |  |  |
| facebook.com |  |  |
| youtube.com |  |  |
| aexaware.com\`\`\` | These are **trusted / brand-related domains** that should remain “follow” because they boost brand authority and social linking. |  |
| **Open External Links in New Tab/Window** | ✅ **ON** | Improves UX — visitors stay on your site while exploring referenced sources. Reduces bounce rate. |
| **Affiliate Link Prefix** | Leave empty (unless you use cloaked URLs like `/get/stripe`) | Only relevant if you’re using affiliate or redirect links. You can skip this for now. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Steps**

1.  Click **Save Changes**.
2.  Clear any caching plugin or CDN cache (e.g., Cloudflare, LiteSpeed).
3.  Test a few external links in your blogs — they should:
    *   open in a new tab,
    *   include `rel="nofollow"`,
    *   and not leak SEO juice.

* * *

Would you like me to walk you through the **next Rank Math section (“Breadcrumbs”)** setup next?  
That’s key for showing _Home › Services › Web Development_ style navigation in Google search results — and it improves CTR + site hierarchy understanding.

Perfect ✅ — you’re now in **Rank Math → Images**, which controls SEO behavior for all images on your website (posts, blogs, portfolio, etc.).

This section directly impacts **Google Images ranking, accessibility, and Core Web Vitals**, so let’s configure it perfectly for **Aexaware Infotech** 👇

* * *

🖼️ **Rank Math – Image SEO Settings for Aexaware Infotech**
------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Add missing ALT attributes** | ✅ **ON** | Critical! Automatically inserts `alt` text (based on file name or post title) if missing. This improves accessibility and allows Google to understand your visuals — helps your blog & project screenshots appear in **Google Image Search**. |
| **Add missing TITLE attributes** | ✅ **ON** | Adds a `title` tag for images without one. It enhances user experience (tooltip text) and helps screen readers. |
| **Add missing image caption** | ❌ **OFF** | Don’t auto-generate captions — they’ll clutter design layouts (especially with Elementor). Keep captions intentional, not automated. |
| **Add missing image description** | ✅ **ON** | Helpful for portfolio and service pages — gives Google more semantic context for each image. |
| **Change title casing** | **No change** | Keep as-is. Avoid forcing capitalization so text looks natural (e.g., “web app UI mockup” not “Web App Ui Mockup”). |
| **Change alt attribute casing** | **No change** | Same reasoning — keeps your alt tags SEO-friendly and natural. |
| **Change description casing** | **No change** | Leave it natural for readability. |
| **Change caption casing** | **No change** | Leave off for design consistency. |
| **Add ALT attributes for avatars** | ✅ **ON** | Adds alt tags for commenter avatars using their names — improves accessibility and removes SEO warnings. |
| **Replacements (Find/Replace)** | Leave **blank** for now | Use only if you want to bulk-correct terms (e.g., replace “webapp” → “web app”). Not needed unless you find common typos later. |

* * *

### 💡 **Extra Tip – Image Performance**

After enabling these:

*   ✅ Install **Imagify** (or Smush/LiteSpeed if already active) to **compress** and convert images to **WebP**.
*   ✅ Keep featured image file names descriptive (e.g., `aexaware-web-development.png` instead of `IMG_001.png`).
*   ✅ Use one primary image per blog/service page for rich preview cards (Open Graph).

* * *

### ✅ Recommended Setup Summary

| Feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Add missing ALT | ✅ On |
| Add missing TITLE | ✅ On |
| Add missing CAPTION | ❌ Off |
| Add missing DESCRIPTION | ✅ On |
| Add ALT for Avatars | ✅ On |

Then click **Save Changes**.

## Response:
Perfect 🔧 — you’ve now reached the **Rank Math → “Others”** section.  
This area includes advanced or optional settings that affect RSS feeds, analytics data, and how Rank Math behaves in headless setups.

Here’s the **best configuration for Aexaware Infotech (WordPress business + blog website)** 👇

* * *

⚙️ **Rank Math – “Others” Settings (Recommended Setup for Aexaware Infotech)**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Headless CMS Support** | ❌ **OFF** | You’re using WordPress as a standard site, not a decoupled (headless) CMS. Enabling this only adds unnecessary API endpoints. |
| **Show SEO Score to Visitors** | ❌ **OFF** | Keep this disabled — showing your SEO score publicly looks unprofessional and adds clutter. Only you should see it in the backend. |
| **Usage Tracking** | ⚙️ **Optional (your choice)** | If you want to help Rank Math improve features, enable it. It sends only anonymous data. It won’t affect SEO. |
| **RSS Before Content** | ✅ Add this: `<p>This article was originally published on <a href="%BLOGLINK%">Aexaware Infotech</a>. Visit us for more tech insights.</p>` | Helps prevent content scraping — if someone republishes your RSS feed, this credits Aexaware automatically. |
| **RSS After Content** | ✅ Add this: `<p>© %BLOGLINK% — Aexaware Infotech builds scalable web, mobile & AI solutions. <a href="%POSTLINK%">Read the full article</a>.</p>` | Adds a copyright notice and backlink to your site at the end of every RSS post — protects authorship and boosts backlinks. |
| **Remove Media Data from RSS feed** | ✅ **ON** | Keeps your RSS feed clean and light by removing unnecessary attachment/image data (helps avoid bloating or duplicate image issues). |
| **Enable Search Intent** | ✅ **ON** | This is a new Rank Math AI feature that helps determine **keyword intent** (informational, transactional, etc.) when optimizing content — useful for your blog strategy. |

* * *

### ✅ **Summary Setup**

| Option | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Headless CMS Support | ❌ Off |
| Show SEO Score | ❌ Off |
| Usage Tracking | Optional |
| RSS Before Content | ✅ Custom credit paragraph |
| RSS After Content | ✅ Copyright + backlink |
| Remove Media Data from RSS | ✅ On |
| Enable Search Intent | ✅ On |

* * *

### 🧠 Why This Setup Is Ideal

*   Protects your content in RSS feeds (auto back-links).
*   Keeps site performance optimized.
*   Enables Rank Math’s AI insights for keyword strategy.
*   Avoids exposing internal SEO data to users.

* * *

Once done, click **💾 Save Changes**.

Would you like me to walk you through the **next critical configuration — “Webmaster Tools”** (to connect Google Search Console, Bing, Pinterest, and IndexNow) so your pages start indexing faster?

NotificationsBe careful when editing the htaccess file, it is easy to make mistakes and break your site. If that happens, you can restore the file to its state before the last edit by replacing the htaccess file with the backup copy created by Rank Math in the same directory ( .htaccess_back_xxxxxx ) using an FTP client. I understand the risks and I want to edit the file

## Response:
Excellent 👏 — you’ve opened **Rank Math → 404 Monitor**, one of the most useful SEO maintenance tools.

This feature tracks broken or missing pages (404 errors) that can hurt user experience **and** SEO rankings if left unfixed.  
Let’s set it up correctly for **Aexaware Infotech** 👇

* * *

🚨 **Rank Math – 404 Monitor Settings (Recommended Setup for Aexaware Infotech)**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mode** | ✅ **Advanced** | Logs _full details_ for each 404, including the **referrer URL** (where the visitor came from). This helps you fix bad backlinks or internal link mistakes quickly. |
| **Log Limit** | ✅ **1000** | Keeps enough historical data for meaningful analysis but avoids database bloat. (Default 100 is too low for an active business site.) |
| **Exclude Paths** | Add these to the exclusion list:  
`/wp-admin/`  
`/wp-login`  
`/xmlrpc.php`  
`/favicon.ico` | Excludes admin & system URLs that bots or spammers often hit, preventing clutter in your 404 log. |
| **Ignore Query Parameters** | ✅ **ON** | Ensures `/page?utm_source=linkedin` and `/page` are treated as the same URL — avoids duplicate 404 entries from tracking links. |

* * *

### 💡 **How to Use 404 Monitor Effectively**

1.  After enabling, visit **Rank Math → 404 Monitor** once a week.
2.  Look for repeated missing URLs or typos (e.g., `/blog/webdevlopment` instead of `/blog/web-development`).
3.  Fix them using **Rank Math → Redirections**:
    *   Source URL: the broken one
    *   Destination URL: the correct one
    *   Type: **301 (Permanent)**

This combination keeps visitors happy and preserves SEO authority.

* * *

### ✅ **Summary Setup**

| Option | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Mode | Advanced |
| Log Limit | 1000 |
| Exclude Paths | `/wp-admin/`, `/wp-login`, `/xmlrpc.php`, `/favicon.ico` |
| Ignore Query Parameters | On |

Then click **💾 Save Changes**.

* * *

Would you like me to show you the **best Redirection setup** next — so that any broken links you find here automatically redirect to the right page instead of losing SEO value?

## Response:
Perfect 🎯 — you’ve reached the final and most powerful section of Rank Math: **Analytics**.  
This integrates your **Google Search Console**, **Google Analytics (GA4)**, and optionally **AdSense**, right into WordPress.

Here’s how to configure this section perfectly for **Aexaware Infotech**, ensuring you get accurate SEO insights, keyword tracking, and automated reports 👇

* * *

📊 **Rank Math – Analytics Settings (Recommended Setup for Aexaware Infotech)**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **✅ Search Console Integration**

| Option | Recommended Setting | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Site** | `https://aexaware.com/` | Ensure this matches your verified domain property in Google Search Console (GSC). If you haven’t yet, verify via GSC → Domain property → `aexaware.com`. |
| **Country** | **Worldwide** | You serve global clients, so keep the scope international. |
| **Enable Index Status tab** | ✅ **ON** | Adds an “Index Status” tab in Rank Math Analytics so you can quickly see which pages are indexed or not — crucial for SEO monitoring. |

* * *

### **✅ Google Analytics Integration (GA4)**

| Option | Recommended Setting | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Account / Property / Data Stream** | Select your GA4 property (`aexaware`) | This connects your analytics data to Rank Math. |
| **Install Analytics Code** | ⚙️ **ON only if no other plugin adds GA** | If you **don’t use Site Kit or a GA plugin**, turn this ON so Rank Math injects the tracking code. If you already use Site Kit or Tag Manager — leave it OFF to avoid duplicates. |
| **Anonymize IP Addresses** | ✅ **ON** | Complies with privacy laws (GDPR) — anonymizes last digits of visitor IPs. |
| **Self-Hosted Analytics JS File** | ❌ **OFF** | Only needed for advanced privacy setups. Not required here. |
| **Exclude Logged-in Users** | ✅ **ON** | Prevents your team’s admin visits from skewing analytics data. |
| **Analytics Database** | **180** | Stores 6 months of SEO + Analytics data for trend tracking. Ideal for growing sites. |
| **Google Core Updates in Graphs** | ✅ **ON** | Visually shows Google algorithm updates — helps you correlate ranking changes. |

* * *

### **✅ AdSense (Optional)**

If you don’t use AdSense → **ignore or leave blank**.  
If you plan to monetize blog content later → reconnect with AdSense permissions.

* * *

### **📧 Email Reports (SEO Performance)**

| Option | Recommended Setting | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Turn on Email Reports** | ✅ **ON** | Sends automatic SEO summary reports to your inbox. |
| **Email Frequency** | **Every 30 days** | Monthly is best for tracking gradual growth. |
| **Report Email Address** | `marketing@aexaware.com` (or your main business email) | Avoid using personal Gmail; use your company email for professionalism. |
| **Report Email Subject** | `Aexaware Infotech – Monthly SEO Performance Report` | Branded subject looks professional. |
| **Report Logo** | Upload your company logo (512x512 PNG) | Used in email header. |
| **Report Header Background** | `linear-gradient(90deg, #0066CC 0%, #00B4DB 100%)` | Replace default purple-blue with Aexaware’s brand blue tones. |
| **Include Sections** | ✅ Select All except “Top Losing Posts/Keywords” (optional) | Focus on growth and opportunities. |
| **Include Only Tracked Keywords** | ❌ **OFF** (for now) | You want to see all organic keywords, not just manually tracked ones. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Steps**

1.  **Click “Save Changes.”**
2.  Ensure your **Google Search Console** and **GA4** are connected and verified.
3.  Wait 24 hours — Rank Math will start pulling live analytics, keyword positions, CTR, and impressions.
4.  After syncing, go to **Rank Math → Analytics → SEO Performance tab** to view live reports.

* * *

### 🚀 Pro Tip

Once data starts flowing, you can:

*   Track keyword movements directly in WordPress.
*   See which blogs and service pages gain/lose traffic.
*   Correlate ranking spikes with Google Core Updates.
*   Use “Index Status” tab to quickly reindex missing pages.

* * *

Would you like me to now give you the **final Rank Math “post-setup checklist”** (the steps you should do right after finishing setup — sitemap submission, schema validation, and index request settings)? That will finalize your SEO foundation.

Excellent, Jainil 👏 — you’re now inside **Rank Math → Titles & Meta → Global Meta**, which defines the **default SEO behavior** for your entire website.

This step is critical — it ensures consistent indexing, rich previews on social media, and better control over how Google and users see your pages.

Let’s set it up _perfectly_ for **Aexaware Infotech** 👇

* * *

🌐 **Rank Math – Global Meta Settings (Recommended for Aexaware Infotech)**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Robots Meta** | ✅ **Index**  
❌ **No Follow**  
❌ **No Archive**  
❌ **No Image Index**  
❌ **No Snippet** | You want your pages indexed and crawled normally. Don’t restrict Google from following or archiving your site — this maximizes visibility. |
| **Advanced Robots Meta** | Snippet = `-1`  
Video Preview = `-1`  
Image Preview = `Large` | `-1` means “no limit.” This ensures full snippets and large preview images in search results (great for CTR). |
| **Noindex Empty Category and Tag Archives** | ✅ **ON** | Prevents empty categories/tags from being indexed — avoids “thin content” penalties. |
| **Separator Character** | `–` (en dash) | Clean, professional — appears between title elements like: `Web Development – Aexaware Infotech`. |
| **Capitalize Titles** | ❌ **OFF** | Keep it off — automated capitalization can break brand or keyword formatting (e.g., “AI/ML Solutions” could become “Ai/Ml Solutions”). |
| **OpenGraph Thumbnail** | Upload your default OG image (1200×630 px) | This appears when someone shares your page on social media and no featured image exists. Use a branded image with your logo + tagline: _“Aexaware Infotech – Smart IT Solutions That Scale.”_ |
| **Twitter Card Type** | ✅ **Summary Card with Large Image** | Displays full-width image previews on Twitter/X and LinkedIn — improves engagement. |
| **Custom Image Watermarks** | ⚙️ _Optional_ | You can upload your logo (bottom-right corner) if you want auto-watermarked images on social shares — useful for brand recognition. |
| **Default Thumbnail Watermark** | Leave blank (unless you set one) | Only set this if you use branded watermarks. |

* * *

### 💡 **Why This Configuration Works**

*   Ensures **all pages** are discoverable and indexable by Google.
*   Automatically enhances your site’s preview appearance on **Facebook, LinkedIn, and X (Twitter)**.
*   Protects from “thin” content issues.
*   Keeps branding consistent in search titles and previews.

* * *

### ✅ **Final Global Meta Summary**

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Robots Meta | Index |
| Advanced Robots | Snippet: -1 / Video: -1 / Image: Large |
| Noindex Empty Archives | ON |
| Separator | – |
| Capitalize Titles | OFF |
| OG Thumbnail | Aexaware default 1200×630 |
| Twitter Card | Summary Card with Large Image |

Then click **💾 Save Changes**.

## Response:
Perfect 🎯 — you’re now in **Rank Math → Titles & Meta → Authors**, which controls how (or if) author archive pages appear in search results.

For **Aexaware Infotech**, since it’s a **company site** (not a multi-author blog or magazine), author archives can create **duplicate content** and dilute SEO.  
Here’s the optimal setup 👇

* * *

👤 **Rank Math – Author Archive SEO Settings (for Aexaware Infotech)**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Author Archives** | ❌ **Disable** | You’re a business, not a content publishing platform. This prevents `/author/jainil-prajapati/` style pages, which usually duplicate blog content. Rank Math will auto-redirect them to your homepage. |
| **Author Base** | _(Keep default `author` or ignore)_ | This won’t matter once archives are disabled. |
| **Author Robots Meta** | If you prefer to keep them enabled → choose **No Index** | Prevents search engines from indexing author archives while keeping them visible to users (if ever needed later). |
| **Author Advanced Robots** | Snippet = `-1`  
Video = `-1`  
Image Preview = `Large` | Standard settings for consistency — doesn’t affect much since archives will be off. |
| **Author Archive Title** | `%name% %sep% %sitename%` | Default is fine; won’t be used if disabled. |
| **Author Archive Description** | Leave **blank** | No need since we’re disabling these pages. |
| **Slack Enhanced Sharing** | ❌ **OFF** | Not needed unless you’re running a multi-author content hub. |
| **Add SEO Controls** | ✅ **ON** | Keeps the meta box available in your user profile — handy if you later add multiple content authors. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Recommended Setup Summary**

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Author Archives | Disabled |
| Robots | (If Enabled) → No Index |
| Snippet Length | \-1 |
| Image Preview | Large |
| Slack Sharing | Off |
| SEO Controls | On |

* * *

### 🧠 Why Disable Author Archives?

*   Prevents **duplicate content** (Google sees both `/blog/post-name/` and `/author/author-name/` as the same).
*   Keeps your crawl budget focused on key pages (services, blog posts, portfolio).
*   Keeps URLs clean and avoids unnecessary indexed pages.

* * *

Click **💾 Save Changes** after applying these.

* * *

Would you like me to walk you through the **“Misc Pages”** section next?  
That’s where we finalize SEO settings for search pages, 404 pages, and archives — so every remaining part of your WordPress site is 100% SEO-optimized and error-free.

## Response:
Perfect 🎯 — you’re in **Rank Math → Titles & Meta → Misc Pages**, which controls SEO settings for “special” pages such as **404s, internal search results, and archives**.

For **Aexaware Infotech**, these settings are crucial to prevent duplicate or low-value pages from being indexed while keeping everything SEO-clean.

Here’s the **ideal configuration** 👇

* * *

⚙️ **Rank Math – Misc Pages Settings (Recommended for Aexaware Infotech)**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Disable Date Archives** | ✅ **ON** | Prevents WordPress from creating `/2025/11/` style URLs — these can duplicate your blogs by date and hurt SEO. |
| **404 Title** | `Page Not Found – Aexaware Infotech` | Keeps branding clear and consistent. Add a custom 404 design later with a CTA like “Go back to Home.” |
| **Search Results Title** | `%search_query% %sep% %sitename%` | Perfect default — dynamically shows what a user searched for (e.g., “AI blog – Aexaware Infotech”). |
| **Noindex Search Results** | ✅ **ON** | Prevents internal search pages (like `/?s=devops`) from being indexed — Google considers them thin/duplicate content. |
| **Noindex Subpages** | ✅ **ON** | Stops paginated archives (like `/page/2/`) from being indexed — only the first page matters for SEO. |
| **Noindex Paginated Single Pages** | ✅ **ON** | Keeps paginated content of long posts from being indexed separately (avoids “duplicate page” issues). |
| **Noindex Password Protected Pages** | ✅ **ON** | Protects private/internal content from being indexed accidentally by Google. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Recommended Setup Summary**

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disable Date Archives | ON |
| 404 Title | Page Not Found – Aexaware Infotech |
| Search Results Title | %search\_query% %sep% %sitename% |
| Noindex Search Results | ON |
| Noindex Subpages | ON |
| Noindex Paginated Single Pages | ON |
| Noindex Password Protected Pages | ON |

* * *

### 💡 **Why This Setup Is Perfect**

*   Stops Google from indexing **low-value pages** (search, archives, duplicates).
*   Keeps the crawl budget focused on high-quality pages (home, services, blogs).
*   Prevents internal duplication penalties.
*   Keeps your sitemap and index **100% clean and efficient**.

* * *

Once done, click **💾 Save Changes**.

* * *

✅ With this, your **Titles & Meta section is 100% complete.**  
Next step (if you’d like) — I can help you finalize the **“Post Types”** configuration:  
that’s where we customize meta titles, descriptions, and schema defaults for **Posts, Pages, and Service sections** — essential for keyword-rich snippets and higher CTR.

Perfect, Jainil 👏 — you’re now in **Rank Math → Titles & Meta → Posts**, which controls the default SEO, schema, and social display for every blog article you publish on **Aexaware Infotech**.

This section is vital — it ensures all your posts automatically use clean, keyword-optimized metadata, correct schema, and proper internal linking suggestions.

Let’s configure it _perfectly for Aexaware’s brand and SEO goals_ 👇

* * *

📝 **Rank Math – Posts (Recommended Setup for Aexaware Infotech)**
------------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Single Post Title** | `%title% %sep% %sitename%` | Keeps it dynamic and SEO-optimized (e.g., “Why Linux Still Dominates Servers in 2025 – Aexaware Infotech”). |
| **Single Post Description** | `%excerpt% %sep% %sitename%` | Pulls the post’s excerpt (first paragraph or meta description). Keeps descriptions unique for every blog automatically. |
| **Schema Type** | ✅ **Article** | Best schema for blog posts. Enables rich results in Google search. |
| **Headline** | `%seo_title%` | Ensures your headline in structured data matches your SEO title (helps CTR). |
| **Description** | `%seo_description%` | Uses your SEO description field automatically for Schema markup consistency. |
| **Article Type** | ✅ **BlogPosting** | Ideal for your blogs (“Tech Insights”, “AI”, “DevOps” etc.). “NewsArticle” is only for media outlets. |
| **Autodetect Video** | ✅ **ON** | If your post includes a video, Rank Math will automatically add **Video Schema** — great for visibility in video-rich results. |
| **Autogenerate Image** | ✅ **ON** | Ensures each post has a default image (if a video is present) — prevents schema errors. |
| **Post Robots Meta** | Leave as **default (Index)** | Uses your global meta setup, which already allows indexing. |
| **Link Suggestions** | ✅ **ON** | Enables Rank Math to suggest internal links while you write. Boosts internal SEO by linking related blogs/services. |
| **Link Suggestion Titles** | ✅ **ON** | Uses the **focus keyword** instead of long titles for anchor text — makes links more natural and keyword-rich. |
| **Primary Taxonomy** | ✅ **Categories** | Keeps breadcrumbs organized by topic (“AI/ML”, “Linux”, etc.) instead of tags. |
| **Slack Enhanced Sharing** | ✅ **ON** | Adds “author” and “read time” when shared on Slack or Discord — makes it look polished. |
| **Add SEO Controls** | ✅ **ON** | Enables Rank Math’s meta box on each post editor — for per-post optimization. |
| **Bulk Editing** | ✅ **ON** | Lets you update multiple post meta titles/descriptions at once from the post list — saves time during audits. |
| **Custom Fields** | _(Optional)_ Add if you use ACF or custom post data (e.g., “project\_type”) | Only needed if you have custom metadata used in analysis. |
| **Default Thumbnail Watermark** | _(Optional)_ Add your logo watermark if you enabled watermarked social images. | Helps maintain brand identity on shared post images. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Recommended Configuration Summary**

| Feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Schema Type | Article → BlogPosting |
| Autodetect Video | ON |
| Autogenerate Image | ON |
| Link Suggestions | ON |
| Link Suggestion Titles | ON |
| Primary Taxonomy | Categories |

* * *

### 💡 **Why This Setup Is Ideal**

    *   Optimized meta title + description.
    *   Correct **Article Schema** (for Google rich snippets).
    *   Auto-internal linking suggestions.
    *   SEO consistency without manual setup every time.
*   Great for your adaptive blog-writing prompt and Linux/AI content pipeline.

* * *

Once done, click **💾 Save Changes**.

* * *

Would you like me to guide you next through the **“Pages”** section (for your main service pages — Web Dev, AI/ML, Cloud & DevOps, etc.) so they all get proper schema, titles, and meta defaults automatically?

Excellent, Jainil 👏 — you’re now in **Rank Math → Titles & Meta → Pages**, which sets the default SEO, Schema, and meta structure for all **Aexaware Infotech’s service and static pages** (Home, About, Services, Contact, Portfolio, etc.).

Since this section defines how your _core business pages_ appear in Google, we’ll optimize it for **clarity, conversion, and professional branding** 👇

* * *

🧱 **Rank Math – Pages (Recommended Setup for Aexaware Infotech)**
------------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Single Page Title** | `%title% %sep% %sitename%` | Keeps your service page titles clean and consistent — e.g., “Web Development – Aexaware Infotech”. |

| **Headline** | `%seo_title%` | Matches your SEO title field, maintaining consistency in structured data. |
| **Description** | `%seo_description%` | Pulls your meta description into schema automatically — avoids missing data warnings. |

| **Link Suggestions** | ✅ **ON** | Enables Rank Math’s internal link suggestions for cross-linking between services, blogs, and portfolio. |

Perfect 👌 — you’re now in **Rank Math → Titles & Meta → Categories**, which controls how your **blog category pages** (like _AI/ML_, _Web Development_, _DevOps_, etc.) appear in Google.

For a business + blog website like **Aexaware Infotech**, category pages _can_ help SEO — but only if configured cleanly to avoid duplicate or thin content issues.

Here’s the best configuration 👇

* * *

🗂️ **Rank Math – Categories Settings (for Aexaware Infotech)**
---------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Category Archive Titles** | `%term% %sep% %sitename%` | Clean, SEO-friendly format. Example: _AI/ML – Aexaware Infotech_ — helps with keyword relevance in SERPs. |
| **Category Archive Descriptions** | `%term_description%` | Pulls your written category description (you should manually add a short 1–2 line intro for each category, e.g. “Insights and guides on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by Aexaware Infotech.”). |
| **Category Archives Robots Meta** | ✅ **Index** | Keep categories **indexed** (they group related posts and help search engines understand topical structure). But only if each category contains **3+ posts**.  
Otherwise → set to **Noindex** to avoid thin pages. |
| **Slack Enhanced Sharing** | ✅ **ON** | When you share a category (like _AI/ML Blogs_) in Slack, it shows total post count and description — looks professional. |
| **Add SEO Controls** | ✅ **ON** | Allows you to edit meta title, description, and schema per category — essential for optimizing key topic hubs. |
| **Bulk Editing** | ✅ **ON** | Lets you quickly mass-edit multiple categories from the dashboard — perfect for keeping consistency. |
| **Remove Snippet Data** | ❌ **OFF** | Keep schema data — it helps Google understand category relationships (as `CollectionPage` schema). |
| **Default Thumbnail Watermark** | _(Optional)_ | Use only if you want watermarked thumbnails when sharing categories on social platforms. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Recommended Setup Summary**

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Title | `%term% %sep% %sitename%` |
| Description | `%term_description%` |
| Robots Meta | Index (or Noindex for low-content categories) |
| Slack Sharing | ON |
| SEO Controls | ON |
| Bulk Editing | ON |
| Remove Snippet Data | OFF |

* * *

### 💡 **Pro Tip – Optimize Each Category Page**

After saving:

1.  Go to **Posts → Categories** in WordPress.
2.  Edit each key category (e.g., _Web Development_, _AI/ML_, _Linux_).
3.  Add:
    *   A **60–70 character SEO title**
    *   A **1–2 sentence meta description**
    *   A short **intro paragraph** (appears on the category page) — use primary keywords naturally.
4.  Add a **featured image** if possible — improves Open Graph and sharing previews.

This turns each category into a **topic hub page**, which improves topical authority and user navigation.

* * *

Once done, click **💾 Save Changes.**

* * *

Would you like me to walk you through the **“Tags”** setup next? That’s the final taxonomy setting — and it’s crucial for avoiding duplicate/thin tag pages that can hurt SEO if left default.

## Response:
Perfect, Jainil 👏 — you’re now in **Rank Math → Titles & Meta → Tags**, which controls SEO behavior for your **post tags** (e.g., “React”, “Machine Learning”, “Cloud”, etc.).

This section is important — but _if not configured properly_, tag pages can hurt your SEO by creating **duplicate, low-content pages** that Google devalues.  
Let’s configure it perfectly for **Aexaware Infotech** 👇

* * *

🏷️ **Rank Math – Tags Settings (Recommended for Aexaware Infotech)**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tag Archive Titles** | `%term% %sep% %sitename%` | Keeps a clean format if tag pages are ever indexed (e.g., “Machine Learning – Aexaware Infotech”). |
| **Tag Archive Descriptions** | `%term_description%` | Pulls any custom description you add to tags — though in most cases, tags will be **noindexed**. |
| **Tag Archives Robots Meta** | ✅ **No Index** | **Most important:** Tag pages often duplicate category and post content. Setting them to **noindex** prevents Google from wasting crawl budget on them or flagging duplicate content. |
| **Tag Archives Advanced Robots Meta** | Snippet: `-1`  
Video Preview: `-1`  
Image Preview: `Large` | Default safe setup — doesn’t limit snippet length or image size. |
| **Slack Enhanced Sharing** | ❌ **OFF** | No need — you won’t typically share tag pages on Slack. |
| **Add SEO Controls** | ✅ **ON** | Keeps the option open to manually edit specific tags in the future (for keyword grouping or internal linking). |
| **Bulk Editing** | ✅ **ON** | Lets you mass-edit tags easily from the dashboard if needed. |
| **Remove Snippet Data** | ✅ **ON** | Removes schema from tag pages since we’re not indexing them. This prevents structured data duplication and schema errors. |
| **Default Thumbnail Watermark** | _(Optional)_ | You can skip this — not relevant for non-indexed tag pages. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Recommended Setup Summary**

| Option | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Title | `%term% %sep% %sitename%` |
| Description | `%term_description%` |
| Robots Meta | **Noindex** |
| Remove Snippet Data | **On** |
| Slack Enhanced Sharing | **Off** |
| SEO Controls | **On** |
| Bulk Editing | **On** |

* * *

### 💡 **Why “Noindex” Is the Best Choice**

*   Tags often overlap with categories and posts (duplicate topics).
*   Prevents “thin content” warnings in Google Search Console.
*   Focuses your SEO value on posts, categories, and service pages.
*   Keeps your sitemap clean and efficient (Rank Math automatically excludes noindexed tags).

* * *

✅ **Click “Save Changes.”**  
Your **Titles & Meta → Tag configuration** is now complete — and your **entire Rank Math SEO Titles & Meta structure** is fully optimized.

* * *

Would you like me to give you the **final post-setup checklist** now (covering sitemap submission, schema validation, Google Search Console linking, and page indexing strategy)?  
That will complete your **entire Rank Math SEO setup** and make sure everything’s indexed correctly by Google.

## Response:
Perfect, Jainil 👏 — you’re now reviewing **Rank Math → Sitemap Settings**, which controls how Google and Bing crawl your website’s structure.  
A well-optimized sitemap ensures every valuable page on **Aexaware Infotech** is indexed while excluding design or duplicate elements.

Here’s the complete **best-practice configuration** for your company 👇

* * *

🗺️ **Rank Math Sitemap Settings (Aexaware Infotech Optimal Setup)**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### **🔧 General Tab**

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Links Per Sitemap** | `200` (default) | Ideal balance between crawl efficiency and sitemap size. |
| **Images in Sitemaps** | ✅ **ON** | Allows Google to index images from blog posts and portfolio (important for image SEO). |
| **Include Featured Images** | ✅ **ON** | Ensures your featured images appear in Google Images and social previews. |
| **Exclude Posts** | Leave **blank** | Only add specific IDs if you want to hide internal/test pages from search. |
| **Exclude Terms** | Leave **blank** | Same — only use if certain taxonomy terms shouldn’t be indexed (like “Uncategorized”). |

📍 **Your Main Sitemap:**  
👉 [https://aexaware.com/sitemap\_index.xml](https://aexaware.com/sitemap_index.xml)

* * *

### **📋 HTML Sitemap Tab**

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HTML Sitemap** | ✅ **Enable** | Helps visitors (and crawlers) navigate all key pages in one place. |
| **Display Format** | `Shortcode` → `[rank_math_html_sitemap]` | Add this shortcode to a dedicated page, e.g., `/sitemap/`. |
| **Sort By** | `Published Date` | Shows newest posts first — keeps sitemap fresh for users. |
| **Show Dates** | ❌ **OFF** | Cleaner, simpler design (dates unnecessary). |
| **Item Titles** | ✅ **Post Titles** | Displays normal post/page titles for clarity. |

📝 Create a WordPress page titled **“HTML Sitemap”** → paste `[rank_math_html_sitemap]`.

* * *

### **📰 Post Types (Posts & Pages)**

| Type | Setting | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Posts** | ✅ **Include in Sitemap**  
✅ **Include in HTML Sitemap** | Ensures all blog posts are indexed and accessible. |
| **Pages** | ✅ **Include in Sitemap**  
✅ **Include in HTML Sitemap** | Includes service pages, About, Contact, etc. |
| **Attachments** | ❌ **Exclude** | Attachment pages are redirected to parent pages — no need to index them. |
| **Elementor/Template/Widgets/Builder Types** | ❌ **Exclude** | These are design or layout files — not real content for indexing. |

🟢 **Keep Only:**

*   Posts
*   Pages

* * *

### **🏷️ Taxonomies**

| Taxonomy | Setting | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Categories** | ✅ **Include in Sitemap** | Helps Google understand topic clusters like “AI/ML” or “Web Development.” |
| **Include Empty Terms** | ❌ **OFF** | Exclude empty categories (thin pages). |
| **Tags** | ❌ **Exclude** | Tag archives are **noindexed** in your earlier setup — don’t include them here. |

* * *

### **📍 Local Sitemap (KML File)**

| Setting | Recommended Action | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Include KML File in Sitemap** | ✅ **ON** | Adds your `locations.kml` file to the sitemap — this provides geo coordinates to Google Maps & improves Local SEO visibility. |
| **KML File URL** | [https://aexaware.com/locations.kml](https://aexaware.com/locations.kml) | Ensure it’s accessible — validates your local business info. |

* * *

### ✅ **Final Sitemap Setup Summary**

| Section | Status |
| --- | --- |
| General | ON (Images + Featured Images included) |
| HTML Sitemap | Enabled + Shortcode on `/sitemap/` page |
| Posts | Included |
| Pages | Included |
| Attachments | Excluded |
| Elementor/Other Builders | Excluded |
| Categories | Included |
| Tags | Excluded |
| Local Sitemap (KML) | Enabled |

* * *

### 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1.  Go to **Google Search Console → Sitemaps**  
    Submit:
    ```
    https://aexaware.com/sitemap_index.xml
    ```
2.  Test your sitemap in **Bing Webmaster Tools** as well.
3.  Create a simple **HTML Sitemap** page (visible in your footer for users).
4.  Monitor indexing status inside **Rank Math → Analytics → Index Status** after a week.

* * *

Would you like me to now give you your **final Rank Math SEO post-setup checklist** (covering schema validation, sitemap submission, index verification, and performance tracking)? That’s the last step to fully lock in your SEO foundation.
