If you’ve heard of the European Accessibility Act (EAA) and the June 28, 2025, compliance deadline, you may be wondering: What does it mean for me as a designer and for the UX industry as a whole? Whether you’re preparing for compliance or simply want to make sure you’re keeping up with best practices and consumer expectations, it’s time to make accessible design a priority. In this guide, we explain everything you need to know about the European Accessibility Act. We’ll also share practical steps to help you prioritise accessibility within your own design practice and ultimately create better products and experiences for everyone.

## **What is the European Accessibility Act?**

The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is a law created by the European Union to ensure that crucial products and services are easier for people with disabilities to use. It means that things like websites, smartphones, ATMs, ticket machines, e-books, and public transport apps must be designed in a way that’s accessible to everyone, including people with vision, hearing, or mobility issues. The main goal of the Act is to create more inclusive products and services across Europe, with all EU member states being held to the same guidelines and standards. But the European Accessibility Act has actually been around since 2019, so why the sudden interest now? Although the Act has been in effect for years, 2025 marks an important compliance deadline. As of 28th June 2025, any new products or services launched within the European Union must fully comply with the EAA. Products and services that already exist have another five years — until 28th June 2030 — to meet accessibility standards. Beyond that, failure to comply may result in severe penalties. So, who exactly needs to take note of the EAA and prepare for compliance? Let’s take a look.
